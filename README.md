# This personal project was made on Android Studio, using Java programming language #
# The goal was to create an E-commerce application, dedicated with second-hand game transactions between the users. 
# Also, the app's target was to encourage the users to sell/buy more games from each other, and each transaction can give an reward from it in form of game-points.
# Within these points, the user can unlock 3 different discount tickets from the app market, which it has an single-use function per transaction.
# The app was implemented with cloud Firebase database.
